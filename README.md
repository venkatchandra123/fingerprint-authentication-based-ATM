# fingerprint-authentication-based-ATM
The objective of our project is to provide biometric security through fingerprint authentication in ATM application. Also the experiments illustrate the key issues of fingerprint recognition that are consistent with what the available literatures say. The underlying principle is the phenomenon of biometrics “AUTHENTICATION”, in this project we propose a method for fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching.    Fingerprint verification is to verify the authenticity of one person by his fingerprint. The user provides his fingerprint together with his identity information like his PIN-CODE. The fingerprint verification system retrieves the fingerprint template according to the PIN-CODE and matches the template with the real time acquired fingerprint from the user. Usually it is the underlying design principle of AFAS (Automatic Fingerprint Authentication System). Fingerprint identification is to specify one person’s identity by his fingerprint(s). Without knowledge of the person’s identity, the fingerprint identification system tries to match his fingerprint(s) with those in the whole fingerprint database. It is especially useful for criminal investigation cases. And it is the design principle of AFIS (Automatic Fingerprint Identification System). However, all fingerprint recognition problems, either verification or identification, are ultimately based on a well-defined representation of a fingerprint.
